AirSpeaker - AirPlay audio player for iOS devices
Copyright (c) 2011 Cl√©ment Vasseur <clement.vasseur@gmail.com>

Use this application to listen to AirPlay audio streams from another iOS device
(iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad running iOS 4.2) on the same local network, or from
iTunes.

Just launch AirSpeaker, then tap the AirPlay icon on the audio player from
another iPhone for example, and the audio should start playing on AirSpeaker.
This works with audio played in iTunes on a Mac or PC too.

This app uses the same "AirTunes" protocol used in Apple's Airport Express,
also known as RAOP (Remote Audio Output Protocol).
